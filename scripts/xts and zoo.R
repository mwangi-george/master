Your first xts object
xts objects are simple. Think of them as a matrix of observations combined with an index of corresponding dates and times.

xts = matrix + times
The main xts constructor takes a number of arguments, but the two most important are x for the data and order.by for the index. x must be a vector or matrix. order.by is a vector which must be the same length or number of rows as x, be a proper time or date object (very important!), and be in increasing order.

xts also allows you to bind arbitrary key-value attributes to your data. This lets you keep metadata about your object inside your object. To add these at creation, you simply pass additional name = value arguments to the xts() function.

Since we are focusing here on the mechanics, we'll use random numbers as our data so we can focus on creating the object rather than worry about its contents.

# Create the object data using 5 random numbers
data <- rnorm(n =5)

# Create dates as a Date class object starting from 2016-01-01
dates <- seq(as.Date("2016-01-01"), length = 5, by = "days")

# Use xts() to create smith
smith <- xts(x = data, order.by = dates)

# Create bday (1899-05-08) using a POSIXct date class object
bday <- as.POSIXct("1899-05-08")

# Create hayek and add a new attribute called born
hayek <- xts(x = data, order.by = dates, born = bday)

# Extract the core data of hayek
hayek_core <- coredata(hayek)

# View the class of hayek_core
class(hayek_core)

# Extract the index of hayek
hayek_index <- index(hayek)

# View the class of hayek_index
class(hayek_index)

# Create dates
dates <- as.Date("2016-01-01") + 0:4

# Create ts_a
ts_a <- xts(x = 1:5, order.by = dates)

# Create ts_b
ts_b <- xts(x = 1:5, order.by = as.POSIXct(dates))

# Extract the rows of ts_a using the index of ts_b
ts_a[index(ts_b)]

# Extract the rows of ts_b using the index of ts_a
ts_b[index(ts_a)]


# Convert austres to an xts object called au
au <- as.xts(austres)

# Then convert your xts object (au) into a matrix am
am <- as.matrix(au)

# Inspect the head of am
head(am)

# Convert the original austres into a matrix am2
am2 <- as.matrix(austres)

# Inspect the head of am2: time attribute is not preserved
head(am2)

# Create dat by reading tmp_file
dat <- read.csv(tmp_file)

# Convert dat into xts
xts(dat, order.by = as.Date(rownames(dat), "%m/%d/%Y"))

# Read tmp_file using read.zoo
dat_zoo <- read.zoo(tmp_file, index.column = 0, sep = ",", format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Convert dat_zoo to xts
dat_xts <- as.xts(dat_zoo)


# Convert sunspots to xts using as.xts().
sunspots_xts <- as.xts(sunspots)

# Get the temporary file name
tmp <- tempfile()

# Write the xts object using zoo to tmp 
write.zoo(sunspots_xts, sep = ",", file = tmp)

# Read the tmp file. FUN = as.yearmon converts strings such as Jan 1749 into a proper time class
sun <- read.zoo(tmp, sep = ",", FUN = as.yearmon)

# Convert sun into xts. Save this as sun_xts
sun_xts <- as.xts(sun)
